Horiseon Re-vamp
I was presented with a mostly working website, and converted it into a user-friendly, accessible piece of work. The navigation bar needed an ID update so when the user clicked the button, it would actually take them to where it claimed.
Next, I updated alt tags onto the websites images so if/when the image doesn't display for the user, a basic description of the image appears.
Finally, I updated the elements of the code body to future coders working in these files will have an easier time navigation the information. Comments were inserted to show breaks between information easily.
